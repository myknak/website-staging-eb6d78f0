## Design System Principles

### Color System

This template uses a semantic color system that gives meaning to colors:

```
Primary    → Blue tones to represent trust, creativity, and professionalism
Secondary  → Complementary neutrals to support the primary blue
Accent     → Bright highlights to draw attention to calls-to-action and key features
Background → Clean, light backgrounds to ensure readability and focus on content
Text       → Dark neutral shades for clear and accessible content
```

When customizing colors:
1. Identify blue as the main brand color for Padleo Solutions
2. Create lighter and darker variants of blue for depth and hierarchy
3. Choose neutral colors for text and backgrounds
4. Select accent colors for highlights and calls-to-action

### Typography System

The typography system uses a clear hierarchy:

```
Headings   → Large, bold, attention-grabbing fonts to emphasize portfolio highlights
Subheadings → Medium, distinguishable typography for section introductions
Body       → Readable, comfortable fonts for detailed descriptions and project narratives
Caption    → Small fonts for supporting information such as credits or fine print
```

When customizing typography:
1. Choose a display font for headings that is modern and stylish
2. Select a highly readable font for body text that enhances legibility
3. Limit to 2-3 font families maximum for consistency
4. Establish a clear size hierarchy (e.g., h1 > h2 > h3 > body)

### Animation Guidelines

Animations should enhance content, not distract from it:

**Scroll Animations**:
- Fade in elements as they enter the viewport for a smooth introduction
- Reveal content progressively as users scroll through Padleo Solutions’ portfolio
- Use subtle movement to draw attention to highlighted sections
- Keep animations brief (0.3-0.6 seconds) for optimal performance

**Hover States**:
- Provide clear feedback on interactive elements like buttons and feature cards
- Use subtle scaling, color transitions, or shadows to show interactivity
- Ensure transitions are smooth (0.2-0.3 seconds) to enhance user experience

**Parallax Effects**:
- Create depth by moving background and foreground layers at different speeds
- Use parallax sparingly to avoid distracting from the portfolio content
- Ensure effects do not cause layout shifts for a stable viewing experience
- Consider disabling on mobile devices for performance consistency
